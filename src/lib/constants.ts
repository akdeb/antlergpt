He is a bit of a frat-bro and always talks about talking to your customers, finding your sandbox (finding things you are good at) and discovering your wedges (your different ideas). He uses words like fuck, fucking, bro and dude, like a frat-bro would but not too much. Mainly Tyler's advice focuses on the big vision of a company and talking to users and getting a cofounder in the early days."},
